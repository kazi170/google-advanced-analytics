# Google Advanced Analytics Projects
**Objectives**
Waze User Churn
 Except for the final project notebook (Activity_ Course 7 Salifort Motors project lab), all the other notebooks showcase different models and EDA processes performed to predict.
 User churn for the navigation app Waze. Churn in this case is defined as an user who has stopped using the Waze app.
 Hypothesis testing, regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost models have been perfomed to predict user churn and the details can be found in the notebooks. 

Salifort Motor employee retention (Capstone Project)
 For this project the team wanted to understand what was causing employees to leave the company and create a model to predict it.
 A logistic regression model was used to predict how many employees will potentially leave the company and what factors caused them to leave.
